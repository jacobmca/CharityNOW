## Credits
This program was created by the group Charitable Coders for the UC Berkeley eDX Coding Boot Camp. The group members are Matt Andrade, Mehrdod Rezvany, Jacob McAuliffe, William Lee, Charles Hutchings, and Stefan Wanigatunga. We also want to thank our TAs who helped temendously throughout the project.

## Tests
In the future, we'd like to further develop this project by creating a profile page for the user. This page would list user details, and track the donations the user has made. Additionally, we'd like to add more organizations to the donate page, and have it populate these groups from the back-end rather than have it all hard-coded to the front-end.
