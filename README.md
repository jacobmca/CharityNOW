## Description
CharityNOW, is a seamless platform where generosity meets simplicity. CharityNOW is a one-page MERN stack website designed to make donating to a variety of charities easy and efficient.
<br>
The inspiration behind CharityNOW stems from the need to simplify charitable giving in the digital age. Many individuals want to contribute to charitable causes but are deterred by cumbersome donation processes and fragmented information. By developing CharityNOW, we aim to:
<br>
1. Enhance Accessibility: Make it easier for people to find and donate to charities from a single, user-friendly platform.
<br>
2. Encourage Engagement: Provide a space where users can actively participate in charitable activities, including creating their own causes.
<br>
3. Educate and Inform: Offer detailed information about various charities to help users make informed decisions about their donations.
